# Introduction

This repository contains codes that I practice as a part of reading the book "Competitive Programmer's Handbook" by Antti Laaksonen.

There is a folder corresponding to the three major sections of the book.
Within each folder, there are folders corresponding to the individual chapters present in those sections.

Download the book from [here](https://cses.fi/book/index.php).
